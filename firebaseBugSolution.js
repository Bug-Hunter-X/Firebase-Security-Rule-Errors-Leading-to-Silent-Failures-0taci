First, ensure your Firebase security rules are properly configured to allow access to the data your application requires.  Second, implement robust error handling in your code.  Use try...catch blocks to catch potential errors and provide feedback to the user.  Consider adding logging to help diagnose issues. Example: 

try {
  // Firebase operation
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Firebase error:", error);
  // Inform the user about the error
}
